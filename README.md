# Comparison-of-Optical-and-SAR-data-for-deforestation-mapping-in-the-Amazon-Forest-with-FCN

This project evaluates Fully Convolutional Networks employing U-Net, Res-Unet, and Siamese architectures for deforestation detection. It leverages imagery from three distinct sensors: Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1. The primary aim is to compare these scenarios and assess the efficacy of SAR data in deforestation detection tasks.
