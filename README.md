# Comparison-of-Optical-and-SAR-data-for-deforestation-mapping-in-the-Amazon-Forest-with-FCN

This project present the evaluation of Fully Convolutional Networks based on the U-Net, Res-Unet and Siamese Network, for deforestation detection using images from three different sensors, Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1. The main objective is to analyze the potential of SAR data for deforestation detection tasks.
